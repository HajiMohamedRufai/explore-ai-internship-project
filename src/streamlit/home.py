## Project description
The aim of this project is to provide an interactive web based dashboard to help farmers gain insights into the various commodity prices of products provided
on the AMIS system. The dashboard contains three pages of valuable visuals organised in terms of produce cartegory. The 
products are: ''')

## Aims and objectives
* Developing a web scraping tool that automatically collects data from different websites and formats.
* Transforming the collected data into a dashboard that applies solid exploratory data analysis (EDA) principles to ensure relevant, useful figures and statistics are presented.
* Testing the dashboard and ensuring that it is user-friendly and easily interpretable by buyers and sellers.
* Evaluating the impact of the automated data scraping and transformation system on the agricultural sector in South Africa.
* Exploring the potential applications of the project in other regions and sectors, providing insights into the benefits of automating data collection and transformation for decision-making.

## Results
The project has achieved its objectives by identifying the different sources and formats of commodity price data in horticulture, grain, and livestock categories
 in South Africa, developing a web scraping tool that automatically collects data from different websites and formats, transforming the collected data, and applying 
 solid exploratory data analysis (EDA) principles to achieve insights. The insights are the driving force of this dashboard which provides a link
 between users and the very valuable but hard to interpret data.
